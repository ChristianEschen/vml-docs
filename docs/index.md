# Autosuggest <small>for intelligent ERP systems</small>

## Automate ERP workflows
Autosuggest is a set of web APIs developed to aid automation in ERP systems. Often customers of ERP systems are performing the same tasks many times a day, as an example every invoice have to be booked on some account from the chart of accounts.
Autosuggest aims to ease these manual tasks, by providing APIs that can give suggestions to the users, so some of that work can be reduced to simply approving what the machine learning predicted.

In the next image we see how Visma e-conomic uses the Autosuggest to fill out accounts for a customer based on bank transfer statements.

## A quick API example

We have demo datasets for all our APIs, the only thing you need to get started is to contact [Claus Dahl](mailto:claus.dahl@visma.com) for an access key.

    Demo datasets are not yet available

Assuming we have previously uploaded a dataset called `user/3124232`, we could call the API like this:

```json
POST /model/scanned-invoice/v2/predict HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer secret-access-token

{
    "dataset": "user/3124232",
    "input": [{"description": "Taxi til kundem√∏de"}],
    "targets": ["account"]
}

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "predictions": [{"account": [{"confidence": 0.19, "label": "3620"}]}]
}
```

Customers often behave differently, needing different predictions to the same input. Therefore it is generally recommended to build a dataset per costumer in order to have the algorithms learn the correct behaviour of each customer.
We exchange user datasets using our secure S3 as shared storage facility. When we handle your data it is always encrypted at rest (with Hardware Security Modules) and in transfer (TLS) with state of the art encryption solutions.
